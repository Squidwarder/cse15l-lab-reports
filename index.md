# CSE 15L (Summer Session 1 2022) Lab Reports

Hello world. This is a repository to store relevant lab assignments for CSE 15L

## Content

Right now I'm making changes using *VSCode* and 
*Github Desktop* to this file.
This is pretty interesting, and I **really**
liked the `Open in VSCode` option in GitHub
Desktop.

This is the [link](https://squidwarder.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports/test1.html) to my first test with another page.

Right now there are 2 other files:

- README.md
- test1.md
